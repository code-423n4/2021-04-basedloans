# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos:
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted, triaged, and deduped, responded to, etc.

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

[ ‚≠êÔ∏è SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE ]

Based Loans is fork of Compound. In theory it should inherit Compound's security. However, any change made to smart contracts can introduce a critical bug. To make it easier for auditors, below is a summary of changes. Be aware that these are not all changes. Do code diff with compound contract to see all changes made.

If you are not familiar with Compound, feel free to read their documentation https://compound.finance/docs
Compound's original code is here: https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master

Changelog:
- `doTransferOut` function in `CEther.sol`
- Renamed `Comp.sol` to `Blo.sol`. Be aware that renaming was made only in few places. Across the code, you'll see variables and functions referencing `blo` and `comp` so keep in mind, it means the same thing (token).
- `UniswapAnchoredView.sol` contract
- `UniswapConfig.sol` contract
- `CErc20Immutable.sol` and `CToken.sol` contracts - mostly function visibility to accommodate new TWAP oracle with on-fly price updates
- `_setCompAddress` function in `Comptroller.sol` - new setter and corresponding storage changes in `ComptrollerStorage`
- Moved `doTransferOut` after storage update in `CToken.sol` for:
    - `_reduceReservesFresh`
    - `redeemFresh`
    - `borrowFresh`
